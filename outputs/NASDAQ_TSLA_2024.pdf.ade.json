Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer\u2019s ability to deliver or perform warranty repairs on vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state. In certain such states, we have opened \u201cgalleries\u201d that serve an educational purpose and where sales may not occur. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.017,t=0.063,r=0.980,b=0.157), with ID 82cd885f-5817-4008-b3ec-ead5d64b8d58 -->\n\nSome automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Certain dealer associations have also actively lobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our own retail and service locations. We expect such challenges to continue, and we intend to actively fight any such efforts. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.017,t=0.163,r=0.966,b=0.225), with ID a142289a-82d0-4481-8d26-2e9f9246bd7a -->\n\n*Battery Safety and Testing*\n\nOur battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of \u201cdangerous goods,\u201d defined to include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation.

To operate our systems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-sale equipment leases by third parties, such as our leases and PPAs, have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.017,t=0.354,r=0.969,b=0.422), with ID 6699e84a-3056-473c-a5e8-2111bf463b3f -->\n\n*Solar Energy\u2014Net Metering*\n\n     Most states in the U.S. make net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.017,t=0.433,r=0.979,b=0.514), with ID 0bfff918-cf3f-4933-8cd6-09adb131b92f -->\n\n**Competition**\n\n**Automotive**\n\n    The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as a significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter the electric vehicle market. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.016,t=0.525,r=0.973,b=0.611), with ID a38ceded-17ad-401e-b2e4-00a91cafc8ca -->\n\nWe believe that our vehicles compete in the market based on both their traditional segment classification as well as their propulsion technology. For example, Cybertruck competes with other pickup trucks, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3 and Model Y compete with small to medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs, all of which are extremely competitive markets. Competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers; however, many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to internal combustion vehicles. Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today in major markets including the U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.017,t=0.617,r=0.980,b=0.749), with ID 30942176-fa70-4ffc-9357-25491514f652 -->\n\n9 <!-- marginalia, from page 1 (l=0.492,t=0.765,r=0.508,b=0.780), with ID 6de7705b-6dd2-4aa5-a015-479c72a90851 -->\n\nTable of Contents <!-- marginalia, from page 2 (l=0.019,t=0.011,r=0.137,b=0.030), with ID 8051455e-36bd-4490-8372-108a8a6196fa -->\n\nWe believe that there is also increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering self-driving technologies, charging solutions and other features and services, and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our Autopilot, FSD (Supervised) and neural network capabilities, Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.018,t=0.056,r=0.979,b=0.104), with ID c9cdc6e0-df9d-49ec-85a2-d2401b668311 -->\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage\n\n    Energy Storage Systems\n\n    The market for energy storage products is also highly competitive, and both established and emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems.

We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.017,t=0.229,r=0.971,b=0.323), with ID b1902dc6-35b0-4280-b525-78845f2ddcfd -->\n\n**Intellectual Property**\n\n     We place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio. As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidential information and other measures, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs across all of our products and technologies as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith.

Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.018,t=0.529,r=0.976,b=0.597), with ID 2b52871d-a7f4-4d37-89ac-206c7ddf1e81 -->\n\nRisks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.019,t=0.608,r=0.373,b=0.626), with ID 6bb3b669-4767-459d-84e8-480a81e07ba1 -->\n\n*We may experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products and features, or we may be unable to control our manufacturing costs.*\n\nWe have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and features. For example, we encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the initial ramp of our first Model X and experienced challenges with a supplier and with ramping full automation for certain of our initial Model 3 manufacturing processes. In addition, we may introduce in the future new or unique manufacturing processes and design features for our products. As we expand our vehicle offerings and global footprint, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.018,t=0.639,r=0.979,b=0.746), with ID 53743691-b452-4b80-ad41-2defdd5f5c9e -->\n\n13 <!-- marginalia, from page 5 (l=0.489,t=0.764,r=0.510,b=0.779), with ID cd257e3f-09e1-47ad-b764-b94eab2cf5b3 -->\n\nTable of Contents <!-- marginalia, from page 6 (l=0.018,t=0.011,r=0.137,b=0.030), with ID f8b6f2f0-701f-43c4-b3fe-40893030611b -->\n\nIn particular, our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of mass-market vehicles. In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China, Germany and any future sites such as Mexico. We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our product ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.017,t=0.057,r=0.976,b=0.159), with ID 245776a3-8518-4bd6-817f-7396d80f29bd -->\n\nWe have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and Solar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future products, features and services based on artificial intelligence. Likewise, we may encounter delays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products. In addition, as we continue to develop our artificial intelligence services and products, we may face many additional challenges, including the availability and cost of energy, processing power limitations and the substantial power requirements for our data centers. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.017,t=0.168,r=0.967,b=0.242), with ID 31e6b5e6-dcaa-4889-a107-b7f7a6d182c2 -->\n\nAny delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of our future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.018,t=0.250,r=0.978,b=0.294), with ID eaba563e-3bf9-43b9-87bf-8a41cdaa64de -->\n\n*Our suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, or we may be unable to manage these components effectively.* <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.052,t=0.308,r=0.967,b=0.340), with ID e2c49ead-654d-4eb0-9474-5289d79807fc -->\n\nOur products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers, which exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages. Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, including inflation of raw material costs, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics, trade and shipping disruptions, port congestions, cyberattacks and other factors beyond our or our suppliers\u2019 control could also affect these suppliers\u2019 ability to deliver technologies or components to us or to remain solvent and operational. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, or face other challenges such as insolvency, it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our production or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time. We have faced in the past, and may face suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, which may increase our costs or require us to replace them with other sources. Finally, as we construct new manufacturing facilities and add production lines to existing facilities, we may experience issues in correspondingly increasing the level of localized procurement at those facilities. While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce, especially in the case of increases in materials pricing. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.016,t=0.352,r=0.978,b=0.593), with ID 19694182-f7b5-4fd9-bac0-44087cf57ea0 -->\n\nAs the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which may harm our business and operating results. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.017,t=0.600,r=0.965,b=0.673), with ID 6c2f1a13-4e79-40d1-9148-d6b8e122c8d3 -->\n\n*We may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines, costs and production ramps at new factories, or we may experience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there.*\n\nOur ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future factories.

Moreover, we will have to establish and ramp production of our proprietary battery cells and packs at our new factories, and we additionally intend to incorporate sequential design and manufacturing changes into vehicles manufactured at each new factory. If we experience any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs, capital efficiency and production capacity for our new factories, expanding and managing teams to implement iterative design and production changes there, maintaining and complying with the terms of any debt financing that we obtain to fund them or generating and maintaining demand for the vehicles we manufacture there, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may be harmed. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.018,t=0.052,r=0.982,b=0.168), with ID 85ebd9ce-708c-42c3-848f-33e9abd63063 -->\n\n*We may be unable to grow our global product sales, delivery and installation capabilities and our servicing and vehicle charging networks, or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth.*\n\nOur success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities. We are targeting a global mass demographic with a broad range of potential customers, in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products. We currently produce numerous international variants at a limited number of factories, and if our specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate, we may not be able to timely generate deliveries matched to the vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a given region.

These plans require significant cash investments and management resources and there is no guarantee that they will generate additional sales or installations of our products, or that we will be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to support them. As we expand, we will also need to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale, installation and servicing of our products, the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of Superchargers.

Currently, we rely on suppliers such as Panasonic and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) for these cells. We have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products. In the long term, we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater volumes and more cost-effective than currently available cells.

The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. For example, as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products, suppliers of these raw materials may be unable to meet our volume needs. Additionally, our suppliers may not be willing or able to reliably meet our timelines or our cost and quality needs, which may require us to replace them with other sources. Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and our growth, and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup such costs through increased prices.

While we attempt to identify and address or remedy defects we identify pre-production and sale, there may be latent defects that we may be unable to detect or control for in our products, and thereby address, prior to their sale to or installation for customers. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.017,t=0.532,r=0.982,b=0.757), with ID 0b46bb2e-5207-4d26-ae22-19253675b271 -->\n\n17 <!-- marginalia, from page 9 (l=0.489,t=0.775,r=0.510,b=0.790), with ID ea9cfc8e-df4f-4b24-ba09-1c6087577a13 -->\n\nTable of Contents <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.018,t=0.011,r=0.137,b=0.030), with ID 77902fdc-0ab3-4bf8-94d4-c12777db3b53 -->\n\n*We may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims.*\n\nThe automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims, and as such we face the risk of such claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other automakers, our vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and such accidents where Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or FSD (Supervised) features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention, especially in light of NHTSA\u2019s Standing General Order requiring reports regarding certain crashes involving vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to face, claims and regulatory scrutiny arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures or alleged misrepresentations of such new technologies that we are pioneering. In addition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While we have designed our battery packs to passively contain any single cell\u2019s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash. Likewise, as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity, they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property. Any product liability claim may subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages, product recalls or redesign efforts, and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it, all of which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time-consuming. In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.016,t=0.062,r=0.984,b=0.295), with ID 517416cd-be9c-4ebb-8617-599840fa1738 -->\n\n*We will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects in order to succeed.*\n\nIn order to maintain and grow our business, we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, investors, ratings agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing, delivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services; our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control. In particular, Tesla\u2019s products, business, results of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are subject to significant amounts of commentary by a range of third parties. Such attention can include criticism, which may be exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team. Any such negative perceptions, whether caused by us or not, may harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.016,t=0.307,r=0.982,b=0.457), with ID 05b4deb0-550d-4deb-8a02-5b2b8846eef4 -->\n\n*We may be unable to effectively grow, or manage the compliance, residual value, financing and credit risks related to, our various financing programs.*\n\nWe offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily ourselves and through various financial institutions. We also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain markets. Depending on the country, such arrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly with us under which we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease, followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease. We have also offered various arrangements for customers of our solar energy systems whereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or purchase electricity generated by them. If we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing these transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.016,t=0.469,r=0.979,b=0.605), with ID cd1c66ae-3896-4e19-9ced-9792c54c7bfa -->\n\nThe profitability of any directly-leased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles\u2019 residual values at the outset of the leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles, economic cycles, legislative changes and the pricing of new vehicles. We have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business, which may impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our vehicle leasing program. The funding and growth of this program also rely on our ability to secure adequate financing and/or business partners. If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds, partners or other financing sources, and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers who may expect or need such options, we may be unable to grow our vehicle deliveries. Furthermore, if our vehicle leasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the resulting greater levels of residual risk. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.017,t=0.611,r=0.981,b=0.741), with ID 8de25fc1-5467-4bdd-bfb6-6c75430196aa -->\n\n18 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.489,t=0.758,r=0.511,b=0.773), with ID 59d9c8bc-c775-4d98-962f-2b88d34ad418 -->\n\nTable of Contents <!-- marginalia, from page 1 (l=0.018,t=0.011,r=0.138,b=0.031), with ID 83213ae3-6d83-425f-a37d-9aa6681caac3 -->\n\nSimilarly, we have provided residual value guarantees to vehicle customers and partners for certain financing programs, under which such counterparties may sell their vehicles through various remarketing channels. However, actual resale values are subject to fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements, such as from one or more of the factors discussed above. If the actual resale values of any vehicles resold by our vehicle customers and partners are lower than the residual values we have agreed to with them, the residual value guarantees may be triggered and, as a result, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.017,t=0.056,r=0.977,b=0.131), with ID f961047d-ee4a-4550-901a-a777139ab8f6 -->\n\nFinally, our vehicle and solar energy system financing programs and our energy storage sales programs also expose us to customer credit risk. In the event of a widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event, our customers may be unable or unwilling to satisfy their payment obligations to us on a timely basis or at all.

These agreements provide for the construction and use of our Gigafactory New York, which we have primarily used for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components and Supercharger components, and for other lessor-approved functions. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during a period that was initially 10 years beginning April 30, 2018. As of December 31, 2024, we have met and expect to meet the requirements under this arrangement, as may be modified and discussed from time to time, based on our current and anticipated level of operations. While we expect to have and grow significant operations at Gigafactory New York and the surrounding Buffalo area, any failure by us in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet all applicable future obligations may result in our incurring financial liabilities in the form of \u201cprogram payments\u201d which would not be expected to have a material adverse effect to our financial operations, the termination of our lease at Gigafactory New York, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations.

In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer. None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success also depends upon our ability to attract, hire and retain a large number of engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and delivery, service, installation, technology and support personnel, especially to support our planned high-volume product sales, market and geographical expansion and technological innovations.

Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability and customer awareness. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.017,t=0.319,r=0.978,b=0.421), with ID 1e817832-f55b-43c9-8f7a-6592d8720af3 -->\n\nThese plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product and manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, during the first quarter of 2024, we experienced a sequential decline in production volumes partially caused by the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory, and factory shutdowns at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack. In the first quarter of 2025, as we launch our New Model Y worldwide, we may similarly experience delays or declines in production volumes due to simultaneous manufacturing ramps in facilities on three continents. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.018,t=0.428,r=0.979,b=0.543), with ID dfc70aae-4cc3-47ac-abde-0b6b18dbc625 -->\n\n*Automotive\u2014Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure*\n\n     Our cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles\u2019 affordability and have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand by improving our vehicles\u2019 performance and functionality, including through product offerings and features based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD (Supervised), and other software, and delivering new vehicles and vehicle options, such as our launch of the updated Model 3 in 2024, and the New Model Y in the first quarter of 2025. In addition, we have been increasing awareness, and expanding our vehicle financing programs, including attractive leasing terms for our customers. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.016,t=0.553,r=0.977,b=0.648), with ID 7fc8bbfd-a136-4817-a022-71cf538662da -->\n\n33 <!-- marginalia, from page 5 (l=0.489,t=0.663,r=0.511,b=0.678), with ID 7aed4aab-23b3-4794-9db1-bbfae78b40b3 -->\n\nHowever, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to shifting consumer trends, political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprise customers. For example, as inflationary pressures increased across the markets in which we operate, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, which impacted the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers\u2019 liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current challenges in the North American automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes to cost. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our operating margin. Changes in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape. We will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production innovation and efficiency at our newest factories and lower logistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors, while our new products will help enable future growth. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.017,t=0.057,r=0.982,b=0.242), with ID 99c3d40b-92a4-4cf6-92a4-4288e68a49dd -->\n\nAs our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our total deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the cost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, as other automotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (\u201cNACS\u201d) and agreements with us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer demands. We also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.017,t=0.249,r=0.981,b=0.352), with ID 63ef9831-04a0-47a3-ac40-a59095b8483d -->\n\n_Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment_\n\n    The long-term success of this business is dependent upon incremental volume growth. We continue to increase the production and capabilities of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the introduction of Powerwall 3 in 2024, and the ramps of our Megafactories in Shanghai and Lathrop, California. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones and logistics. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products. At the same time, changes in government and economic incentives or tariffs may also impact our sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.017,t=0.360,r=0.963,b=0.467), with ID 349f3d19-ce1c-45f0-9d4f-9e4e5ccc2961 -->\n\nCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\n\n     Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously developing and ramping new products, building or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger network and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $11.00 billion in 2025 and in each of the following two fiscal years. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.017,t=0.476,r=0.979,b=0.610), with ID 6c7dda01-dc3a-46af-a9dd-05a0ab356a33 -->\n\nOur business has generally been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also generally facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to invest in autonomy, do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.016,t=0.616,r=0.972,b=0.720), with ID 4426bd29-ef00-4d41-891d-2cfe84eae8d7 -->\n\n34 <!-- marginalia, from page 6 (l=0.487,t=0.736,r=0.513,b=0.752), with ID 089aa8fa-8d7e-4425-9993-937ca34f94a4 -->\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\n    The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.015,t=0.063,r=0.979,b=0.184), with ID 9059d8d4-7388-4135-b995-808c03d6dece -->\n\nThe estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, resale value guarantee liabilities, income tax, the collectability of accounts and finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained.

We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.017,t=0.327,r=0.969,b=0.544), with ID 246a9cd6-a398-455b-98f7-febcf2024da0 -->\n\n*Inventory Valuation*\n\n        Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.016,t=0.556,r=0.970,b=0.622), with ID 883cacb4-a720-4dc7-8257-a27f252101a8 -->\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.017,t=0.629,r=0.978,b=0.689), with ID 13cbb0b5-4bea-43b3-beb9-02b4b2e720a6 -->\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required.

We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.016,t=0.063,r=0.974,b=0.255), with ID 635d9d72-ad62-4e16-b6ed-b8acbd27034d -->\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\n    We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the \u201cESPP\u201d) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.016,t=0.266,r=0.972,b=0.402), with ID 14a1636d-1206-43ac-a6af-5acfd0274f4c -->\n\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.017,t=0.407,r=0.974,b=0.442), with ID 6873e6c5-3a55-4c38-a993-80fc9a4ef459 -->\n\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.017,t=0.447,r=0.982,b=0.508), with ID 491573a7-0b7d-413d-9ecd-b52d66efb4e1 -->\n\n*Income Taxes*\n\n    We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company's projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.016,t=0.521,r=0.979,b=0.685), with ID ea3177b0-449b-48aa-a508-bab721bf5de3 -->\n\n36 <!-- marginalia, from page 8 (l=0.487,t=0.699,r=0.513,b=0.717), with ID fc0ad41e-7a91-42dd-8451-c1f897e1a5af -->\n\nFurthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.016,t=0.056,r=0.981,b=0.202), with ID 28635d2e-54fb-45ce-ad9b-5b070ea20d73 -->\n\nResults of Operations\nRevenues\n\n<table><thead><tr><th></th><th colspan=\"3\">Year Ended December 31,</th><th colspan=\"2\">2024 vs. 2023 Change</th><th colspan=\"2\">2023 vs. 2022 Change</th></tr><tr><th>(Dollars in millions)</th><th>2024</th><th>2023</th><th>2022</th><th>$</th><th>%</th><th>$</th><th>%</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Automotive sales</td><td>$ 72,480</td><td>$ 78,509</td><td>$ 67,210</td><td>$ (6,029)</td><td>(8)%</td><td>$ 11,299</td><td>17 %</td></tr><tr><td>Automotive regulatory credits</td><td>2,763</td><td>1,790</td><td>1,776</td><td>973</td><td>54 %</td><td>14</td><td>1 %</td></tr><tr><td>Automotive leasing</td><td>1,827</td><td>2,120</td><td>2,476</td><td>(293)</td><td>(14)%</td><td>(356)</td><td>(14)%</td></tr><tr><td>Total automotive revenues</td><td>77,070</td><td>82,419</td><td>71,462</td><td>(5,349)</td><td>(6)%</td><td>10,957</td><td>15 %</td></tr><tr><td>Services and other</td><td>10,534</td><td>8,319</td><td>6,091</td><td>2,215</td><td>27 %</td><td>2,228</td><td>37 %</td></tr><tr><td>Total automotive & services and other segment revenue</td><td>87,604</td><td>90,738</td><td>77,553</td><td>(3,134)</td><td>(3)%</td><td>13,185</td><td>17 %</td></tr><tr><td>Energy generation and storage segment revenue</td><td>10,086</td><td>6,035</td><td>3,909</td><td>4,051</td><td>67 %</td><td>2,126</td><td>54 %</td></tr><tr><td>Total revenues</td><td>$ 97,690</td><td>$ 96,773</td><td>$ 81,462</td><td>$ 917</td><td>1 %</td><td>$ 15,311</td><td>19 %</td></tr></tbody></table> <!-- table, from page 9 (l=0.016,t=0.209,r=0.978,b=0.447), with ID 90c1dd70-b3bf-42ca-97a3-3025985f4447 -->\n\n*Automotive & Services and Other Segment*\n\n    Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, including access to our FSD (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates.

Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.019,t=0.662,r=0.976,b=0.750), with ID 296f702e-18be-4ee4-956f-136f3d5121d9 -->\n\n41 <!-- marginalia, from page 3 (l=0.489,t=0.767,r=0.510,b=0.782), with ID 1c58fe69-a78e-44e6-8b2a-1087bd8d6e30 -->\n\nAccordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following December 31, 2024, as well as in the long-term. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.018,t=0.057,r=0.975,b=0.089), with ID e3d3bc43-28e5-4edc-ac3b-8285db991903 -->\n\nSee the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.017,t=0.096,r=0.943,b=0.129), with ID 7fb996e3-e4fb-4ab6-b639-2fab2059d615 -->\n\n*Material Cash Requirements*\n\n     From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products.

These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $1.15 billion at December 31, 2024 and $1.01 billion at December 31, 2023, assuming no foreign currency hedging. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.017,t=0.216,r=0.981,b=0.292), with ID c48371a7-a5bd-48f1-94b7-20401cdcfbdc -->\n\n44 <!-- marginalia, from page 6 (l=0.486,t=0.308,r=0.514,b=0.324), with ID d36e2fff-7199-4a79-9261-f0218a89a67d -->\n\nITEM 8.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.019,t=0.322,r=0.974,b=0.427), with ID a39f2ce8-da25-47bf-97fd-09388dd6e73c -->\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.016,t=0.051,r=0.975,b=0.185), with ID 6b2b4297-86eb-454a-9ed0-6ee1a0ee4405 -->\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.017,t=0.191,r=0.969,b=0.238), with ID 72e31459-573f-4e63-aaf3-7c58a6ef3262 -->\n\n*Critical Audit Matters*\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

The Company provides a manufacturer\u2019s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles. A warranty reserve is accrued for these products sold, which includes management\u2019s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty and recalls if identified.

These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of historical vehicle claims processed and testing that such claims were appropriately used by management in the estimation of future claims and (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimate by (a) developing an independent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and (b) comparing the independent estimate to management\u2019s estimate. Developing the independent estimate involved evaluating the appropriateness of certain aspects of management\u2019s significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims. <!--

We design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our products. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.018,t=0.104,r=0.932,b=0.168), with ID 50008383-8bc2-4a08-bbcc-8bec2423bd90 -->\n\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n\n    The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation (\u201cASC 810\u201d), we consolidate any variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 15, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.017,t=0.182,r=0.980,b=0.391), with ID 19e24fca-1689-4e20-a446-b6628c9e9a02 -->\n\nUse of Estimates\n\n    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, resale value guarantee liabilities, income taxes, the collectability of accounts and finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.018,t=0.405,r=0.980,b=0.539), with ID 5a8ed907-329a-46e0-b472-74f733dfb90e -->\n\n_Reclassifications_\n\n    Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.018,t=0.553,r=0.969,b=0.604), with ID 2215e6c9-a981-4070-a9a6-37f5229453b6 -->\n\n53 <!-- marginalia, from page 6 (l=0.488,t=0.622,r=0.511,b=0.637), with ID 6688492d-7e71-44da-9c5d-a5571cbc83bc -->\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nRevenue by source\n\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions):\n<table><thead><tr><th></th><th colspan=\"3\">Year Ended December 31,</th></tr><tr><th></th><th>2024</th><th>2023</th><th>2022</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Automotive sales</td><td>$ 72,480</td><td>$ 78,509</td><td>$ 67,210</td></tr><tr><td>Automotive regulatory credits</td><td>2,763</td><td>1,790</td><td>1,776</td></tr><tr><td>Energy generation and storage sales</td><td>9,564</td><td>5,515</td><td>3,376</td></tr><tr><td>Services and other</td><td>10,534</td><td>8,319</td><td>6,091</td></tr><tr><td>Total revenues from sales and services</td><td>95,341</td><td>94,133</td><td>78,453</td></tr><tr><td>Automotive leasing</td><td>1,827</td><td>2,120</td><td>2,476</td></tr><tr><td>Energy generation and storage leasing</td><td>522</td><td>520</td><td>533</td></tr><tr><td>Total revenues</td><td>$ 97,690</td><td>$ 96,773</td><td>$ 81,462</td></tr></tbody></table> <!-- table, from page 7 (l=0.016,t=0.095,r=0.978,b=0.336), with ID 332596e8-6197-4780-8cb6-07abc4ff462b -->\n\nAutomotive Segment\n\nAutomotive Sales\n\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our FSD(Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.017,t=0.357,r=0.979,b=0.579), with ID 4d631840-996a-4c22-ad9c-d8f910cd63cc -->\n\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer\u2019s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized upfront as an offset against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.018,t=0.587,r=0.971,b=0.674), with ID 2bdaa211-176a-487c-896c-adbbaf35f311 -->\n\nWe offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under these programs, we originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.018,t=0.681,r=0.971,b=0.728), with ID d8b75d47-a8a6-483e-aaa8-842415e6cc14 -->\n\n54 <!-- marginalia, from page 7 (l=0.487,t=0.744,r=0.511,b=0.760), with ID 4716e025-a979-40bd-b33c-d959e3ecfeba -->\n\nWe receive upfront payment for the vehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the lease term, and we provide a guarantee capped to a limit if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle\u2019s contractual or determined residual value at the end of the lease term. We estimate a guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460, *Guarantees* and record it within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market value of vehicles sold under these programs to determine whether there have been changes to the amount of expected resale value guarantee liabilities. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The total recorded guarantee liabilities on vehicles sold under these programs were immaterial as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Our maximum exposure on the guarantees we provide if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle\u2019s contractual residual value at the end of the lease term was $1.45 billion and $166 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.016,t=0.057,r=0.970,b=0.173), with ID c2df7017-99a5-4f2e-85f2-a2105d6c7849 -->\n\nDeferred revenue related to the access to our FSD (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions): <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.017,t=0.179,r=0.970,b=0.213), with ID 8e2eab34-b72d-438e-8737-4645b509f21e -->\n\n<table><thead><tr><th></th><th colspan=\"2\">Year Ended December 31,</th></tr><tr><th></th><th>2024</th><th>2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Deferred revenue \u2014 beginning of period</td><td>$ 3,536</td><td>$ 2,913</td></tr><tr><td>Additions</td><td>1,343</td><td>1,201</td></tr><tr><td>Net changes in liability for pre-existing contracts, including foreign exchange impact</td><td>(92)</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue recognized</td><td>(1,188)</td><td>(595)</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred revenue \u2014 end of period</td><td>$ 3,599</td><td>$ 3,536</td></tr></tbody></table> <!-- table, from page 8 (l=0.018,t=0.222,r=0.981,b=0.361), with ID 36d52795-4dfd-4341-9b78-83f6156c5d34 -->\n\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $872 million and $469 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2024, we expect to recognize $840 million of revenue in the next 12 months.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had current net financing receivables of $247 million and $242 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net, and $821 million and $1.04 billion, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.017,t=0.453,r=0.964,b=0.500), with ID 053f7c26-63d1-45cd-8e21-9e02c36670f4 -->\n\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\n\n    We earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.017,t=0.513,r=0.977,b=0.565), with ID 39c7ebae-2760-488d-81eb-b13a8e45b100 -->\n\nPayments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated with them, at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was immaterial as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had also recognized $288 million in revenue due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected contract length of one year or less. As of December 31, 2024, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $4.68 billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $863 million in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period. Additionally, changes in regulations on automotive regulatory credits may significantly impact our remaining performance obligations and revenue to be recognized under these contracts. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.017,t=0.571,r=0.976,b=0.730), with ID 6305fc91-7d95-4a01-9830-475e379ea18e -->\n\n55 <!-- marginalia, from page 8 (l=0.486,t=0.745,r=0.513,b=0.763), with ID 58ee718b-7190-471d-b049-8ee9fa1d661f -->\n\n*Automotive Leasing Revenue* <!-- marginalia, from page 9 (l=0.053,t=0.065,r=0.244,b=0.080), with ID 62ed83e7-2f77-4673-8689-8c834b6f838d -->\n\nDirect Vehicle Operating Leasing Program\n\n    We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers may opt to return the vehicles to us or purchase the vehicles when contractually permitted. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $1.78 billion, $1.86 billion and $1.75 billion of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had deferred $394 million and $458 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.017,t=0.085,r=0.980,b=0.204), with ID 2f611e03-7338-4b5d-9aa8-1144587339e0 -->\n\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.053,t=0.212,r=0.729,b=0.230), with ID 1fb94d5b-1146-4c02-b771-c55d27b0f3af -->\n\nDirect Sales-Type Leasing Program\n\n    We have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Our arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $12 million, $215 million and $683 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $7 million, $164 million and $427 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.017,t=0.242,r=0.973,b=0.351), with ID 7023c851-17fa-41f1-a89b-24d160261b1a -->\n\n*Services and Other Revenue*\n\n    Services and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.019,t=0.364,r=0.948,b=0.413), with ID 2813f35b-35bf-4b61-93c7-eed446f04e86 -->\n\nRevenues related to repair, maintenance and vehicle insurance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle components, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within Accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets. We record in Deferred revenue any non-refundable prepayment amounts that are collected from customers and unearned insurance premiums, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred revenue excluding unearned insurance premiums was not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.018,t=0.422,r=0.975,b=0.550), with ID c133dfd0-1c80-4482-b942-955767b98735 -->\n\n*Energy Generation and Storage Segment*\n\n_Energy Generation and Storage Sales_\n\nEnergy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small-scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small-scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small-scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.017,t=0.564,r=0.968,b=0.718), with ID 81ef49b4-3cdf-422c-bbd8-b15113208dff -->\n\n56 <!-- marginalia, from page 9 (l=0.488,t=0.736,r=0.511,b=0.750), with ID fb8a0188-5b6f-4ee4-b99d-ce6ecafada5c -->\n\nFor certain large commercial and utility grade energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.017,t=0.057,r=0.972,b=0.104), with ID d49b7cf8-b007-4111-9fce-0d9c36a6a7a7 -->\n\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using market data for comparable products. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.017,t=0.110,r=0.976,b=0.185), with ID b846ff3f-a64c-4057-a3a9-855777808677 -->\n\nAs part of certain energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract. If an energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.017,t=0.191,r=0.974,b=0.293), with ID 79fb1382-23a2-41ba-b2f3-fd8f78a4f35b -->\n\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are primarily related to prepayments from customers, which is recognized as revenue as or when the performance obligations are satisfied. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $1.77 billion and $1.60 billion, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment terms. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1.27 billion and $571 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2024, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $7.18 billion.

We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (\u201cHLBV\u201d) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third parties. The third parties\u2019 interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.016,t=0.063,r=0.981,b=0.296), with ID 77e13f0f-6feb-4018-a551-9c19ac6f975f -->\n\n*Net Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders*\n\n    Basic net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period.

If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.017,t=0.255,r=0.968,b=0.320), with ID 26123381-f7ea-4c68-b169-03bc696616e7 -->\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.

The new crypto assets standard requires certain crypto assets to be measured at fair value separately on the balance sheet with changes reported in the statement of operations each reporting period. The new crypto assets standard also enhances the other intangible asset disclosure requirements by requiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant crypto asset holding. The new crypto assets standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the new crypto assets standard requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity adopts the amendments. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. However, if the new crypto assets standard is early adopted in an interim period, an entity must adopt the new crypto assets standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. We adopted the new crypto assets standard on a modified retrospective approach effective January 1, 2024. Refer to Note 3, _Digital Assets, Net_ for the inclusion of the new required disclosures.

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value.

All other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date.

Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred.

The valuation allowance change during the years ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to changes in our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.

On August 5, 2023, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, purportedly on behalf of all U.S. individuals impacted by the data incident, followed by several additional lawsuits, that each assert claims under various state laws and seeks monetary damages and other relief. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur in these or other possible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.017,t=0.201,r=0.980,b=0.318), with ID 8c477e60-28dc-4988-b80b-ee1674a23a61 -->\n\n*Letters of Credit*\n\n        As of December 31, 2024, we had $448 million of unused letters of credit outstanding. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.017,t=0.326,r=0.598,b=0.365), with ID 14d9a2e6-2899-42f3-aa95-3b2ab621f87c -->\n\nNote 15 - Variable Interest Entity Arrangements\n\n     We have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles.

Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of outstanding shares of common stock are entitled to receive ratably any dividends declared by our board of directors out of assets legally available. Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any then outstanding shares of preferred stock.

These provisions and certain provisions of Texas law, which are summarized below, are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed, in part, to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate more favorable terms with an unfriendly or unsolicited acquirer outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging a proposal to acquire us. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.017,t=0.182,r=0.974,b=0.296), with ID f46d209f-c4df-44ea-a3a6-0747359d0c70 -->\n\nLimits on Ability of Shareholders to Act by Written Consent or Call a Special Meeting\n\n        Our Certificate of Formation provides that our shareholders may act by written consent only if all holders of shares entitled to vote on such action adopts a resolution by unanimous written consent. This may deter action by written consent or lengthen the amount of time required to take shareholder actions. As a result, even a holder controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to amend our Bylaws or remove directors without holding a meeting of our shareholders called in accordance with our Bylaws. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.017,t=0.302,r=0.966,b=0.402), with ID eb846433-c50e-4540-b089-c1403b5ee727 -->\n\nIn addition, our Certificate of Formation provides that special meetings of shareholders may be called by the chairperson of the board, the chief executive officer, the president (to the extent required by the TBOC), our board of directors, or by shareholders holding not less than 50% (or the highest percentage of ownership that may be set under the TBOC) of the Corporation\u2019s then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at such meeting. The threshold required for shareholders to call a special meeting may delay the ability of our shareholders to force consideration of a proposal or for holders controlling a majority of our capital stock to take any action, including the removal of directors. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.019,t=0.408,r=0.977,b=0.496), with ID 2e5d7a1e-e199-4c82-abf7-0336ff1b8040 -->\n\n**Requirements for Advance Notification of Shareholder Nominations and Proposals**\n\n    Our Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to shareholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of our board of directors or a committee of our board of directors. These provisions may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed. These provisions may also discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.018,t=0.503,r=0.974,b=0.603), with ID 10de6132-bfab-4799-8729-9e44d1ea21cf -->\n\n**Board Classification**\n\n    Our board of directors is divided into three classes, one of which classes is elected each year by our shareholders to serve for a three-year term. A third party may be discouraged from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us as it is more difficult and time-consuming for shareholders to replace a majority of the directors on a classified board. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.018,t=0.610,r=0.978,b=0.682), with ID ebe24d8b-fa49-49ce-9e87-11fde791cee0 -->\n\n2 <!-- marginalia, from page 6 (l=0.036,t=0.745,r=0.058,b=0.761), with ID 7ff5abb5-1482-44ef-89fd-f304acf931a3 -->\n\nNo Cumulative Voting\n\n        Our Certificate of Formation and Bylaws do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors. Cumulative voting allows a shareholder to vote a portion or all of its shares for one or more candidates for seats on the board of directors. Without cumulative voting, a minority stockholder may not be able to gain as many seats on our board of directors as the shareholder would be able to gain if cumulative voting were permitted. The absence of cumulative voting makes it more difficult for a minority shareholder to gain a seat on our board of directors to influence our board\u2019s decision regarding a takeover. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.015,t=0.079,r=0.982,b=0.181), with ID 61c8b9f5-bbe6-419e-817f-621af20fb27b -->\n\n**Amendment of Certificate of Formation Provisions**\n\n    The amendment of our Certificate of Formation requires approval by holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.016,t=0.186,r=0.959,b=0.246), with ID c4d30af6-c748-4247-8c51-3aef5d4250d3 -->\n\n## Texas Anti-Takeover Statute\n\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 21.606 of the TBOC regulating corporate takeovers. In general, Section 21.606 prohibits a publicly held Texas corporation from engaging, under certain circumstances, in a business combination with an affiliated shareholder for a period of three years following the date the person became an affiliated shareholder unless:\n\n-  prior to the date of the transaction, our board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the shareholder becoming an affiliated stockholder; or\n\n-  at or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of shareholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the affiliated stockholder at a meeting of shareholders called for that purpose not less than six months after the affiliated shareholder\u2019s share acquisition date. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.016,t=0.251,r=0.967,b=0.430), with ID fa9bff9f-3011-432d-bc7c-52bb2752383d -->\n\nGenerally, a business combination includes a merger, share exchange, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested shareholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or, within three years prior to the determination of interested shareholder status did own, 15% or more of a corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock. We expect the existence of this provision to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions our board of directors does not approve in advance. We also anticipate that Section 21.606 may also discourage attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by shareholders. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.016,t=0.435,r=0.965,b=0.525), with ID 1e2d74a8-e5dd-49e9-a1a0-b759792105ba -->\n\nThe provisions of Texas law and the provisions of our Certificate of Formation and Bylaws could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting hostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they might also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. These provisions might also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that shareholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.017,t=0.530,r=0.981,b=0.607), with ID 02b18cca-182e-44f8-af33-aa04eb3cdc8f -->\n\n3 <!-- marginalia, from page 7 (l=0.037,t=0.682,r=0.057,b=0.698), with ID c994b49e-dba1-47b9-9b9e-26b689d7f609 -->\n\nExhibit 19 <!-- marginalia, from page 7 (l=0.891,t=0.695,r=0.980,b=0.713), with ID 1e3cc50a-d1c2-47e3-8770-90d9749e2bdd -->\n\nTESLA, INC. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.444,t=0.008,r=0.554,b=0.030), with ID 7cd5d624-7093-45f2-8ca2-e53cf21e5b76 -->\n\nINSIDER TRADING POLICY\n\nand\n\nGuidelines with Respect to Certain Transactions in Securities <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.247,t=0.063,r=0.753,b=0.124), with ID bbb5882a-e1eb-49cc-b761-85f8b6a9b8c4 -->\n\n<table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">TABLE OF CONTENTS</th></tr><tr><th></th><th>Page</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>INTRODUCTION</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal prohibitions on insider trading</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detection and prosecution of insider trading</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penalties for violation of insider trading laws and this Policy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insider Trading Compliance Officer</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporting violations</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal responsibility</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>PERSONS AND TRANSACTIONS COVERED BY THIS POLICY</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons covered by this Policy</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Types of transactions covered by this Policy</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibilities regarding the nonpublic information of other companies</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicability of this Policy after your departure</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No exceptions based on personal circumstances</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Material\" information</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Nonpublic\" information</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>POLICIES REGARDING MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidentiality of nonpublic information</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No trading on material nonpublic information</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No disclosing material nonpublic information for the benefit of others</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to outside inquiries for information</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>TRADING BLACKOUT PERIODS</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quarterly blackout periods</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special blackout periods</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulation BTR blackouts</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No \"safe harbors\"</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>PRE-CLEARANCE OF TRADES</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS AND GUIDANCE</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short sales</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derivative securities and hedging transactions</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Company securities as collateral for loans</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding Company securities in margin accounts</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placing open orders with brokers</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>LIMITED EXCEPTIONS</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transactions pursuant to a trading plan that complies with SEC rules</td><td>9</td></tr></tbody></table> <!-- table, from page 9 (l=0.023,t=0.110,r=0.978,b=0.839), with ID 0babf37b-c9f2-4cac-850f-8f5860157d10 -->\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Receipt and vesting of stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights</td>\n    <td>10</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Exercise of stock options for cash</td>\n    <td>10</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Purchases from the employee stock purchase plan</td>\n    <td>10</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Certain 401(k) plan transactions</td>\n    <td>10</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions</td>\n    <td>11</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Inheritance and bona fide gifts</td>\n    <td>11</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Change in form of ownership</td>\n    <td>11</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Other exceptions</td>\n    <td>11</td>\n  </tr>\n</table> <!-- table, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.108,r=0.972,b=0.260), with ID 0bd04dc8-10fb-486d-9dec-2e5ee0804675 -->\n\n- COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT  11\n  -

In addition, requiring pre-clearance of transactions by directors and officers facilitates compliance with Rule 144 resale restrictions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the liability and reporting provisions of Section 16 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201c**Exchange Act**\u201d) and Regulation BTR. Pre-clearance of a trade, however, is not a defense to a claim of insider trading and does not excuse you from otherwise complying with insider trading laws or this Policy. Further, pre-clearance of a transaction does not constitute an affirmation by the Company or the Insider Trading Compliance Officer that you are not in possession of material nonpublic information. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.023,t=0.192,r=0.967,b=0.295), with ID 8c47a435-57dd-4030-8679-3c31c853d046 -->\n\nThe Insider Trading Compliance Officer is under no obligation to approve a transaction submitted for pre-clearance, and may determine not to permit the transaction. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.024,t=0.300,r=0.966,b=0.333), with ID 0b391cf8-dcf1-4b64-a581-776fc17db7d1 -->\n\n**ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS AND GUIDANCE**\n\nThis section addresses certain types of transactions that may expose you and the Company to significant risks. You should understand that, even though a transaction may not be expressly prohibited by this section, you are responsible for ensuring that the transaction otherwise complies with other provisions in this Policy that may apply to the transaction, such as the general prohibition against insider trading as well as pre- clearance procedures and blackout periods, to the extent applicable. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.023,t=0.339,r=0.967,b=0.428), with ID bcb3a4cf-43ed-476d-a251-47f26fe1c2e6 -->\n\nShort sales\n\n    Short sales (*i.e.*, the sale of a security that must be borrowed to make delivery) and \u201cselling short against the box\u201d (*i.e.*, a sale with a delayed delivery) with respect to Company securities are prohibited under this Policy. Short sales may signal to the market possible bad news about the Company or a general lack of confidence in the Company\u2019s prospects, and an expectation that the value of the Company\u2019s securities will decline. In addition, short sales are effectively a bet against the Company\u2019s success and may reduce the seller\u2019s incentive to improve the Company\u2019s performance. Short sales may also create a suspicion that the seller is engaged in insider trading. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.024,t=0.433,r=0.967,b=0.546), with ID e68cb12a-507f-4bde-8415-ef81bd024bc7 -->\n\nDerivative securities and hedging transactions\n\n    You are prohibited from engaging in transactions in publicly-traded options, such as puts and calls, and other derivative securities with respect to the Company\u2019s securities. This prohibition extends to any hedging or similar transaction designed to decrease the risks associated with holding Company securities. Stock options, stock appreciation rights, other securities issued pursuant to Company benefit plans or other compensatory arrangements with the Company, and broad-based index options, futures or baskets are not subject to this prohibition. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.023,t=0.552,r=0.966,b=0.653), with ID 7ee662b7-3cf4-442b-a134-1dd417689553 -->\n\nTransactions in derivative securities may reflect a short-term and speculative interest in the Company\u2019s securities and may create the appearance of impropriety, even where a transaction does not involve trading on inside information. Trading in derivatives may also focus attention on short-term performance at the expense of the Company\u2019s long-term objectives. In addition, the application of securities laws to derivatives <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.024,t=0.658,r=0.966,b=0.721), with ID bb52a8be-272d-4b09-b474-94c4b10cc582 -->\n\nPage 8 <!-- marginalia, from page 8 (l=0.858,t=0.742,r=0.913,b=0.760), with ID 6ec4c237-73d0-40e1-a46b-1bdeb36d7bf1 -->\n\ntransactions can be complex, and persons engaging in derivatives transactions run an increased risk of violating securities laws.\n\nUsing Company securities as collateral for loans\n\n    You should exercise caution in pledging Company securities as collateral for loans. If you default on the loan, the lender may sell the pledged securities as collateral in a foreclosure sale. The sale, even though not initiated at your request, is still considered a sale for your benefit and, if made at a time when you are aware of material nonpublic information or otherwise are not permitted to trade in Company securities, may result in inadvertent insider trading violations, Section 16 and Regulation BTR violations (for officers and directors), violations of this Policy and unfavorable publicity for you and the Company. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.023,t=0.093,r=0.965,b=0.211), with ID 789c97d1-3c7e-4668-ae49-47c2b463fefc -->\n\nHolding Company securities in margin accounts\n\n    You may not hold Company securities in margin accounts. Under typical margin arrangements, if you fail to meet a margin call, the broker may be entitled to sell securities held in the margin account without your consent. The sale, even though not initiated at your request, is still considered a sale for your benefit and, if made at a time when you are aware of material nonpublic information or are otherwise not permitted to trade, may result in inadvertent insider trading violations, Section 16 violations (for officers and directors), violations of this Policy and unfavorable publicity for you and the Company. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.023,t=0.218,r=0.966,b=0.319), with ID 2be43606-1bf3-44e0-85a2-c8cbce20ca7e -->\n\nPlacing open orders with brokers\n\n    Except in accordance with an approved trading plan (as discussed below), you should exercise caution when placing open orders, such as limit orders or stop orders, with brokers, particularly where the order is likely to remain outstanding for an extended period of time. Open orders may result in the execution of a trade at a time when you are aware of material nonpublic information or otherwise are not permitted to trade in Company securities, which may result in inadvertent insider trading violations, Section 16 and Regulation BTR violations (for officers and directors), violations of this Policy and unfavorable publicity for you and the Company. If you are subject to any blackout periods or pre-clearance requirements, you should inform any broker with whom you place any open order at the time it is placed of your obligation to comply with such blackout periods and/or pre-clearance requirements. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.024,t=0.324,r=0.967,b=0.465), with ID 836c94ef-94c9-46fd-b4dd-c71eedcbcffa -->\n\n**LIMITED EXCEPTIONS**\n\n    The following are certain limited exceptions to the restrictions imposed by the Company under this Policy. Please be aware that even if a transaction is subject to an exception to this Policy, you will need to separately assess whether the transaction complies with applicable law. For example, even if a transaction is indicated as exempt from this Policy, you may need to comply with the \u201cshort-swing\u201d trading restrictions under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, to the extent applicable. You are responsible for complying with applicable law at all times. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.025,t=0.472,r=0.967,b=0.572), with ID b0fbbc9a-994b-4635-865f-4fb5bd348703 -->\n\n**Transactions pursuant to a trading plan that complies with SEC rules**\n\n    The SEC has enacted rules that provide an affirmative defense against alleged violations of U.S. federal insider trading laws for transactions pursuant to trading plans that meet certain requirements. In general, these rules, as set forth in Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, provide for an affirmative defense if you enter into a contract, provide instructions or adopt a written plan for trading securities when you are not aware of material nonpublic information. The contract, instructions or plan must be made or entered into in good faith and not as a part of a plan or scheme to evade the insider trading laws and must (i) specify the amount, price and date of the transaction, (ii) specify an objective method for determining the amount, price and date of the transaction and/or (iii) place any subsequent discretion for determining the amount, price and <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.024,t=0.578,r=0.967,b=0.708), with ID 836063a3-6510-4723-98e9-4ca81b17aecd -->\n\nPage 9 <!-- marginalia, from page 9 (l=0.858,t=0.728,r=0.912,b=0.746), with ID b942b709-2d29-4b23-bd1d-5f05cbb5780f -->\n\ndate of the transaction in another person who is not, at the time of the transaction, aware of material nonpublic information. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.025,t=0.094,r=0.920,b=0.112), with ID fbe53248-88e5-4cd8-9ff6-b7af68024c4c -->\n\nTransactions made pursuant to a written trading plan that (i) complies with the affirmative defense set forth in Rule 10b5-1 and (ii) is approved by the Insider Trading Compliance Officer, are not subject to the restrictions in this Policy against trades made while aware of material nonpublic information or to the pre- clearance procedures or blackout periods established under this Policy. In approving a trading plan, the Insider Trading Compliance Officer may, in furtherance of the objectives expressed in this Policy, impose criteria in addition to those set forth in Rule 10b5-1. Therefore, you must confer with the Insider Trading Compliance Officer prior to entering into any trading plan. No transactions may occur under such contract, instructions or plans until the expiration of the applicable cooling-off period (minimum of 90 days for directors and officers and 30 days for all other employees and agents). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.027,t=0.113,r=0.964,b=0.226), with ID 72429818-f630-4b9f-b1a5-a99fa7981941 -->\n\nThe SEC rules regarding trading plans are complex and must be complied with completely to be effective. The description provided above is only a summary, and the Company strongly advises that you consult with your personal legal advisor if you intend to adopt a trading plan. While trading plans are subject to review and approval by the Company, the individual adopting the trading plan is ultimately responsible for compliance with Rule 10b5-1 and ensuring that the trading plan complies with this Policy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.027,t=0.234,r=0.963,b=0.306), with ID 1dfec203-b71d-49b9-a995-2701517020ac -->\n\nTrading plans must be filed with the Insider Trading Compliance Officer.

The trading restrictions under this Policy also do not apply to the vesting, cancellation or forfeiture of stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock or stock appreciation rights in accordance with applicable plans and agreements.

Likewise, the trading restrictions under this Policy do not apply to the exercise of stock options in a stock-for-stock exercise with the Company or an election to have the Company withhold securities to cover tax obligations in connection with an option exercise. However, the trading restrictions under this Policy do apply to (i) the sale of any securities issued upon the exercise of a stock option, (ii) a cashless exercise of a stock option through a broker, since this involves selling a portion of the underlying shares to cover the costs of exercise, and (iii) any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an option. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.027,t=0.461,r=0.963,b=0.587), with ID fa80885a-c834-4c0d-91ce-ae0813f3614d -->\n\nPurchases from the employee stock purchase plan\n\n    The trading restrictions in this Policy do not apply to elections with respect to participation in the Company\u2019s employee stock purchase plan or to purchases of securities under the plan.

Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In November 2021, we began to offer Supercharger access to non-Tesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy, and in November 2022, we opened up our previously proprietary charging connector as the North American Charging Standard (NACS). This enables electric vehicles and charging stations to interoperate \u2014 which makes charging easier and more efficient for everyone and advances our mission to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy. Following this, all major automotive companies announced their adoption of NACS in certain markets, with their access to the Supercharger network beginning in phases in 2024 and their production of NACS vehicles beginning no later than 2025. We also engaged SAE International to govern NACS as an industry standard, now named J3400. We continue to monitor and increase our network of Tesla Superchargers in anticipation of future demand.",

Net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so.",

For example, Cybertruck competes with other pickup trucks, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3 and Model Y compete with small to medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs, all of which are extremely competitive markets. Competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers; however, many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to internal combustion vehicles. Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today in major markets including the U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions.",

Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, or face other challenges such as insolvency, it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our production or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time. We have faced in the past, and may face suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, which may increase our costs or require us to replace them with other sources. Finally, as we construct new manufacturing facilities and add production lines to existing facilities, we may experience issues in correspondingly increasing the level of localized procurement at those facilities. While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce, especially in the case of increases in materials pricing.

As is true for other automakers, our vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and such accidents where Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or FSD (Supervised) features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention, especially in light of NHTSA\u2019s Standing General Order requiring reports regarding certain crashes involving vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to face, claims and regulatory scrutiny arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures or alleged misrepresentations of such new technologies that we are pioneering. In addition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While we have designed our battery packs to passively contain any single cell\u2019s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash. Likewise, as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity, they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property. Any product liability claim may subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages, product recalls or redesign efforts, and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it, all of which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time-consuming. In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance.",

Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing, delivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services; our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control. In particular, Tesla\u2019s products, business, results of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are subject to significant amounts of commentary by a range of third parties.

The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened, causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated, and our results of operations may be harmed.",

In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state franchise laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers anywhere in the world. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model.

Additionally, our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results, especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or investors, who may be focused only on short-term quarterly financial results. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.",

At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.",

We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time.

In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation (\u201cASC 810\u201d), we consolidate any variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 15, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.",

Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time.

We have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (\u201cHLBV\u201d) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third parties. The third parties\u2019 interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount.

The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion.

The new crypto assets standard also enhances the other intangible asset disclosure requirements by requiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant crypto asset holding. The new crypto assets standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the new crypto assets standard requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity adopts the amendments. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. However, if the new crypto assets standard is early adopted in an interim period, an entity must adopt the new crypto assets standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period.

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value.

The valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets increased by $332 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, and decreased by $6.46 billion and $1.73 billion during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The valuation allowance increase during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to the changes of our California deferred tax assets, U.S. foreign tax credits and certain foreign operating losses. The change in valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance with respect to our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets. In the fourth quarter of 2023, based on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our taxable income in recent years which was objective and verifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it is more likely than not that most of our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets are realizable and released the valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance change during the years ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to changes in our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our deferred tax assets without a valuation allowance are more likely than not to be realized given the expectation of future earnings in the respective jurisdictions.",

Trial was held November 14-18, 2022. On January 30, 2024, the Court issued an opinion finding that the 2018 CEO Performance Award should be rescinded. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel filed a brief seeking a fee award of 29,402,900 Tesla shares, plus expenses of $1,120,115.50. Tesla opposed the fee request, and at Tesla\u2019s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 72% of the disinterested voting shares of Tesla, excluding shares owned by Mr. Musk and Kimbal Musk, voted to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Because Tesla\u2019s disinterested stockholders voted to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award, Mr. Musk and the other director defendants, joined by Tesla, filed a brief seeking to revise the Court\u2019s January 30, 2024 opinion. On December 2, 2024, the Court issued an opinion denying the motion to revise the Court\u2019s January 30, 2024 opinion and awarded Plaintiff\u2019s counsel fees in the amount of $345 million. A final judgment was entered by the Court, and the director defendants and Tesla appealed the decisions to the Delaware Supreme Court.",

This case was later consolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and other relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016, to the present. On October 5, 2022, a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same defendants. On September 30, 2023, the Court dismissed this action with leave to amend the complaint. On November 20, 2023, the plaintiff moved to amend the complaint, which Tesla opposed.

Tesla opposed the motion. On September 30, 2023, the Court denied the request for a preliminary injunction, compelled four of five plaintiffs to arbitration, and dismissed the claims of the fifth plaintiff with leave to amend the complaint. On October 31, 2023, the remaining plaintiff in the Northern District of California action filed an amended complaint, which Tesla moved to dismiss, and on May 15, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Tesla\u2019s motion. On October 2, 2023, a similar proposed class action was filed in San Diego County Superior Court in California. Tesla subsequently removed the San Diego County case to federal court and on January 8, 2024, the federal court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Tesla moved to compel arbitration, which the plaintiff did not oppose, and on June 27, 2024, the Court stayed the case pending arbitration.",

These provisions are also designed, in part, to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate more favorable terms with an unfriendly or unsolicited acquirer outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging a proposal to acquire us.",
